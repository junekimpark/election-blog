            Introduction: This week, I focused on polling to help predict the 2022 House party seat share (%) for Democrats and Republicans.
What Do Forecasters Do? FiveThirtyEight’s approach to forecasting congressional elections is as follows, “take lots of polls, perform various types of adjustments to them, and then blend them with other kinds of empirically useful indicators (what we sometimes call “the fundamentals”) to forecast each race. Then they account for the uncertainty in the forecast and simulate the election thousands of times” (Silver, 2022).

            Introduction: This week, I focused on evaluating predictive models that used national economic variables as predictors for the incumbent party’s vote margin (%) in House congressional races. My goal was to better understand the economic model of voting behavior of congressional elections.
Previous Literature: Achen and Bartels (2017) analyzed the economic model of voting behavior of presidential races. They found that, “it is possible to account for recent presidential election outcomes with a fair degree of precision solely on the basis of how long the incumbent party had been in power and how much real income growth voters experienced in the six months leading up to Election Day.

            Hello! My name is June Park and I am a junior at the college studying Government on the data science track and this is the beginning of my blog for GOV 1347: Election Analytics.
This week, I focused on visualization customization of congressional races.
Map of Republican/Democrat Vote Share Margin by STATE (2016, 2018):
The first set of maps represent the two-party vote share margin in the 2016 and 2018 congressional elections.
