<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week, I reflect on my predictive model for the 2022 House of Representatives elections based on the actual results of the 2022 elections. To summarize, I predicted that the Democrats would win 216 seats, while the Republicans would win 219 seats, resulting in a slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives. After reflecting on and analyzing my model based on the actual results, I find that my nationwide results (216 vs 219 seats) is actually quite close to the actual results (213 vs 219; 4 seats uncalled as of November 22, 2022), but my district-by-district results were not so accurate.</p>

<h2>Recapping my 2022 prediction model</h2>
<p>For a more in-depth description and discussion about my model, please visit <a href="https://junekimpark.github.io/election-blog/post/2022-11-04-prediction-for-the-2022-house-midterms/">my last blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Here I will present a short summary of my model: I ran a pooled linear regression model for each of the 435 districts to predict the Democratic two-party vote share at the district level. Then, I aggregated the data so that any districts with less than or equal to 50% for Democratic two-party vote share would be considered a Republican seat, while any districts with more than 50% for Democratic two-party vote share would be considered a Democratic seat. This allowed me to predict the Democratic Party’s seat share at the national level.</p>
<p>My independent variables were:
1. Generic Ballot
2. GDP % Difference
3. Dem Incumbent in District
4. Dem Party is in Power in House
5. Dem President is in Power
6. Previous Dem Two Party Vote Share
7. Expert Ratings</p>
<p>Using my model, I predicted that the <strong>Democrats would win 216 seats, while the Republicans would win 219 seats</strong>, resulting in a slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>My <strong>lower bound</strong> at the 95% confidence level predicted that Democrats would win 213 seats, while the Republicans would win 222 seats, resulting in a larger Republican victory than my prediction.</p>
<p>My <strong>upper bound</strong> predicted that Democrats would win 218 seats, while the Republicans would win 217 seats, resulting in the slimmest Democratic victory possible.</p>
