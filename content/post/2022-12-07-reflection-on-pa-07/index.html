<h2>Introduction of PA-07</h2>
<p>This semester, I closely paid attention to the election happening in <strong>Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District</strong>, which featured a rematch between Democratic incumbent, <strong>Susan Wild</strong>, and Republican challenger, <strong>Lisa Scheller</strong>. In the end, Susan Wild won re-election with about 51% of the vote to Lisa Scheller’s 49%. There was a vote margin of less than 6,000 votes!</p>

<h3>History of PA-07</h3>
<p>Due to the 2020 Census, Pennsylvania lost a seat in reapportionment and had to redraw their maps, which went into effect on February 23, 2022. Included in this process was the redistricting of PA-07, which made the district even <strong>more competitive</strong>. In 2020, Joe Biden won PA-07 with 51.8% of the vote, compared to Donald Trump’s 47.0%. However, when <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/9/29/2055001/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2020-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-new-and-old-districts">Daily Kos</a> calculated what the results of the 2020 presidential election would be based on the newly redistricted boundaries of PA-07, Biden would have received 49.7% of the vote in this district and Trump would have received 49.1%. Hence, the <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/cook-pvi/2022-partisan-voting-index">2022 Cook Partisan Voter Index for PA-07</a> was R+2, which means that in the previous two presidential elections, this district’s results were 2 percentage points more Republican than the national average. <strong>In short, the redistricting of PA-07 did NOT benefit Democratic incumbent, Susan Wild.</strong> As a result, some pundits believed that either Wild would have an extremely difficult time winning re-election or would even lose.</p>
<p>In fact, PA-07 has an incredible history with redistricting.</p>
