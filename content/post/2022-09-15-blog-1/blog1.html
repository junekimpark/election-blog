<p>This week, I looked at the Republican/Democrat voteshare margin of House congressional elections. I analyzed the 2018 and 2014 congressional elections.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Plot of 2018 voteshare margin
plot_usmap(data = house2018, 
           regions = &quot;states&quot;, 
           values = &quot;Votemargin&quot;,
           labels = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = &quot;skyblue3&quot;, 
                       mid = &quot;white&quot;,
                       high = &quot;firebrick3&quot;, 
                       name = &quot;Two-party Voteshare Margin&quot;) +
  labs(title = &quot;2018 Two-Party Voteshare Margin&quot;) +
  theme_void()</code></pre>
