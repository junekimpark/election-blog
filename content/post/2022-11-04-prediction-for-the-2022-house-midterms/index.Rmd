## Introduction
In this week's blog, I present my final prediction model for the 2022 House Midterms. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
# This is a cleaned dataset using all of the code before
# It contains data for most of the 435 districts from 1950-2020
df_new <- read_csv("house_1950_2020.csv")

# Pooled Model of Democratic Vote Share based on
  # Average Generic Ballot
  # GDP Percent Difference Q7 - Q6
  # Incumbent Party at District Level
    # 0 = Republican
    # 1 = Democrat
  # Interaction of GDP and Incumbency
  # Incumbent Party of the House at the Election (before results)
    # R = 0 
    # D = 1
  # Incumbent President's Party at the Election (before results)
    # R = 0 
    # D = 1
  # Previous Democratic Vote Share Result at District Level
  # Average Expert Predictions
    # R = 7
    # D = 1

pooled <- lm(DemVotesMajorPercent ~ average_support + gdp_percent_difference +
          incumb + house_party_in_power_at_election +
          pres_party_in_power_at_election + prev_results_dist + 
          avg_rating, data = df_new)
```

## Predictions for the 2022 House Midterms
